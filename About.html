<h1>Education Goals</h1>
<p>My first education goal is to complete my client side web design ceertification. I will continue classes for my overall major, but I hope to start on another certification in the meantime. Over all i'd like to have a transfer to a 4 year to complete my computer science degree, in hopes to be a programmer or some type of designer. Though it sounds difficult I want to know the most I can possibly know about computers and how they work.</p>
