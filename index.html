<h1>Jeanette Palencia</h1>
<p>Hello my name is Jeanette Palencia this is my first year at cerritos college. I am currently trying to recieve my certification for client side web design. After I graduate I hope to either become a programmer or some kind of developer. I usually spend my days cooking, cleaning, and working. I hope one day to have an office and a whole set up where I can work on programs and hopefully make a difference in the world.</p>
